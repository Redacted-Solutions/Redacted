# Redacted II (RII)
RII is a custom client for Black Ops II with powerful features, including a Lua Engine and compatibility layer for each client.

## Notes
**Custom Lua Engine**: RII includes a powerful Lua Engine for scripting and modding.
**Steam Emulation**: We use a Steam Emulator to emulate Steam servers, providing seamless integration with the game.
**Server Hosting**: Our upcoming application will allow users to host Black Ops II servers similar to Plutonium BO2.
**No Plutonium Support**: We do not support Plutonium due to potential security and compatibility issues. RII is built on the latest Steam version of the game.
**Injection Module**: RII injects a module into the Black Ops II client to modify various aspects, including online functionality and additional features.

## Lua Engine Safety
While there are concerns about safety with the Lua Engine, we prioritize functionality and customization. For more information on the safety considerations, please refer to our soon to exist Discord Server.
